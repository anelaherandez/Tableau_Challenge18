# Tableau_Challenge18
## Challenge Background
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.
    For this project I used January-May 2023 Data

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
Design 2–5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon (4–10 total). You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.
Questions Addressed:
1. How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?
2. What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?
3. What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the winter months?
4. Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?
5. Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?
6. Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why?
7. Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why?

## Project Requirements
Use your visualizations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why the phenomenon may be occurring.
Create one of the following visualizations for city officials:
Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.
Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.
The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis.
Create your final presentation:
Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.

## Analysis and Conclusions
- User Analysis
The CitiBike service is predominately used by as a membership service, rather than a casual service. Approximately 80% of the rides from January to May 2023 were taken by members. There is a slight increase in casual users during the spring/summer months, which is likely due to incoming tourism to the city, however the member still account for the majority of CitiBike rides. 
This trend points to the success of the membership program CitiBike offers, however, it also highlights an area of improvement in marketing to casual rides during the tourism months. 
- Seasonal Analysis
Through the exploration of number of rides by month of both the starting station and the ending station, it is apparent that the number steadily rises from January to May. This is to be expected since New York weather warms up significantly from January to May. 
- Station Popularity Analysis
There is a significant correlation between station usage and locale in New York. All of the top 10 start/end stations are in high traffic areas of Manhattan both in terms of tourist attractions and business centers, as well as transportation hubs. Conversely, the bottom 10 start/end stations are not located on Manhattan Island and the majority reside in New Jersey. This too could be an opportunity to increase membership by making specific deals for those stations and users that frequent stations in New Jersey exclusively.
- Conclusion
Tableau is a great tool for data visualizations and analysis. The CitiBike program in New York has a solid membership following, particularly around Manhattan Island. It is a highly sought after means of transportation in heavy tourist areas and business districts and is even used to transport individuals to New Jersey. Through this data analysis we can see the trends in ridership steadily increase during the Spring and Summer months, as well as understand what time of day the demand for bikes are more prevalent depending on the time of year. The analysis performed in this Tableau workbook will aid in the creation of new marketing campaigns to gain both more members and casual CitiBike users.
